# About me

-   I am a fourth year student majoring in Economics and Finance at the University of Winnipeg. My background in high-school consisted of lots of Computer Science and Math which led to an interest in Data Analysis and Statistics. I also work in Accounts Payable with the Government of Manitoba which has helped me learn essential finance skills.
